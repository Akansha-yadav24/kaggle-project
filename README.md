## Flood Prediction - Project Files
This document outlines the files included in this project for predicting flood probability.

### Files:

start.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook is the main solution file. It contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and prediction.
Sample_submission.csv: This file provides an example of the expected format for your predictions on the test data. It includes an "Id" column for each data point and a "FloodProbability" column where you should place your predicted flood probabilities between 0 and 1.


### Data:

The training and test datasets for this competition are not included here due to size limitations.
You can download them from the Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mukulthakur177/flood-prediction-model
## Getting Started:
Video explanation link: https://youtu.be/bAqj1IzCtTo?si=41gqeCqnl_t6vNmA
* Download the training and test data from Kaggle.
* Open start.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
* Update the file paths in the notebook to point to the downloaded data.
* Run the notebook cells to perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.
* The final predictions will be saved in a new CSV file following the format specified in Sample_submission.csv.
### Note:

This project assumes you have Jupyter Notebook and necessary data science libraries installed.
I hope this helps!
